# Gmail SMTP Setup Instructions

## The Problem
Your Laravel application is failing to send emails due to Gmail authentication issues:
- Error: "Username and Password not accepted"
- The app is using "bloombouqet0@gmail.com" but the password is not being accepted

## Solutions

### Option 1: Update Gmail App Password
1. Go to your Google Account settings (https://myaccount.google.com/)
2. Go to "Security" section
3. Enable "2-Step Verification" if not already enabled
4. Go to "App passwords" section
5. Create a new app password for "Mail" on "Other (Custom name)"
6. Name it "Bloom Bouquet Laravel"
7. Copy the generated app password
8. Update your .env file with this new password:

```
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=bloombouqet0@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=YOUR_NEW_APP_PASSWORD
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="bloombouqet0@gmail.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Bloom Bouquet"
```

### Option 2: Use Mailtrap for Testing
If you just need to test email functionality in a development environment:

1. Create a free account on Mailtrap.io
2. Go to your inbox settings
3. Select Laravel from the integrations dropdown
4. Copy the provided configuration
5. Update your .env file with these credentials:

```
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=your_mailtrap_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_mailtrap_password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="bloombouqet0@gmail.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Bloom Bouquet"
```

### Option 3: Disable Email Verification Temporarily
If you just need to bypass email verification during development:

1. Open `app/Models/User.php`
2. Remove the `implements MustVerifyEmail` interface
3. Update your routes to not require email verification

## After making changes
1. Clear Laravel's cache: `php artisan config:clear`
2. Restart your Laravel server: `php artisan serve`
